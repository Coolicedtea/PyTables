 Announcing PyTables @VERSION@
===========================

We are happy to announce PyTables @VERSION@.


What's new
==========

This release enhances chunked and extensible arrays (CArray/EArray)
compressed with Blosc2 with the optimized read added in PyTables 3.8.0
(based on HDF5 direct chunking).  Slicing such multidimensional arrays
(even along inner dimensions) has been greatly sped up thanks to Blosc2
NDim 2-level partitioning of chunks into smaller multidimensional
blocks, which avoids the decompression of whole chunks.  This is enabled
by providing the Blosc2 CFrame with a b2nd metalayer when writing each
array chunk.  Please check out "Multidimensional slicing and chunk/block
sizes" in the optimization tips section of the User's Guide for more
information.  This development was funded by a NumFOCUS grant.

What it is?
===========

PyTables is a library for managing hierarchical datasets and
designed to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data with
support for full 64-bit file addressing.  PyTables runs on top of
the HDF5 library and NumPy package for achieving maximum throughput and
convenient use.  PyTables includes OPSI, a new indexing technology,
allowing to perform data lookups in tables exceeding 10 gigarows
(10**10 rows) in less than a tenth of a second.

Acknowledgments
===============

Thanks to many users who provided feature improvements, patches, bug
reports, support and suggestions.  See the ``THANKS`` file in the
distribution package for a (incomplete) list of contributors.  Most
specially, a lot of kudos go to the HDF5 and NumPy makers.
Without them, PyTables simply would not exist.
